#' Create and concatenate Place Explorer HTML files
#'
#' This function creates a place explorer HTML file by concatenating a header
#' file with a specific place explorer file, based on the provided df, select_ID
#' and language. It also generates a temporary file to store the concatenated
#' output.
#'
#' @param temp_folder <`character`> The temporary folder of the app. By default
#' will grab the `temp_folder` object as it's already supposed to have been assigned
#' in the `global.R` file
#' @param region <`character`> Region under study, e.g. `CMA`.
#' @param scale <`character`> Scale under study
#' @param select_id <`character`> The ID of the selected polygon.
#' @param lang <`character`> String indicating the language of the place explorer
#' file (either "en" for English or "fr" for French). Default is NULL, which
#' will use English if not specified.
#'
#' @return A list containing the following elements:
#' * src: The relative path to the temporary file, to be used when grabbing
#' the static file for the web server.
#' * file: The absolute path to the temporary file.
