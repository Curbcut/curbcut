#' Trigger the Curbcut map tutorial
#'
#' This function triggers a tutorial for a Curbcut map page. The tutorial
#' guides the user through the app using the rintrojs package, highlighting various
#' elements and providing custom instructions.
#'
#' @param id <`character`> A string representing the ID of the page for which
#' the tutorial will be shown.
#' @param session <`session`> A shiny session object from the server function.
#' The actual session of the module, should be  `session = session`
#' @param server_session <`session`> A session object passed to the server function. It is used
#' to manage cookies in the server-side of the Shiny application. Usually
#' `server_session = r$server_session()`.
#' @param skip_elements <`character vector`> A character vector specifying the IDs
#' of elements to be skipped in the tutorial. Default is NULL, meaning all elements
#' are included.
#' @param lang <`character`> A string specifying the language of the tutorial.
#' Defaults to NULL for no translation.
#'
#' @return The function does not explicitly return a value. It triggers the tutorial
#' using \code{\link[rintrojs]{introjs}} and sets a cookie recording the last time the tutorial
#' was seen.
#'
#' @details The function first builds a dataframe with elements to be highlighted
#' in the tutorial. Each element is identified by its ID, and associated with
#' an instruction and a title. If `skip_elements` is specified, these elements
#' are removed from the dataframe. The tutorial is then triggered using
#' \code{\link[rintrojs]{introjs}}, with instructions and titles drawn from the dataframe.
#' Finally, a cookie is set to record the last time the tutorial was seen.
