\title{Grab DA_ID from a building-street-like dataframe (large!)}
\usage{
grab_DA_ID_from_bslike(scale, select_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{scale}{<\code{character}> A string, the name of the dataframe in which to look
for row. The dataframe should be in the global environment, and if it isn't,
there must be an established sqlite connection to it.}

\item{select_id}{<\code{character}> A value representing the ID that needs to be
selected in order to fetch the corresponding DA_ID.}
}
\value{
The DA_ID corresponding to the given \code{select_id}. If
\code{select_id} is found in the \code{df} in the global environment, the corresponding
DA_ID is returned. If \code{df} is a 'scales_as_DA' and not in the global
environment, the function fetches DA_ID from the connected database.
}
\description{
This function fetches the DA_ID matching with the selected ID from a given
dataframe \code{scale} based on a provided \code{select_id}. It can also fetch the DA_ID
from a connected database when the \code{df} is not found in the global environment
but is identified as a scales_as_DA'. In such cases, it uses the established
connection and fetches the DA_ID via a SQL query.
