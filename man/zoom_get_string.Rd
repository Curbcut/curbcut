\title{Generate zoom string based on given zoom level and region name}
\usage{
zoom_get_string(zoom, zoom_levels, region)
}
\arguments{
\item{zoom}{<\code{numeric}> A numeric value representing the current zoom level}

\item{zoom_levels}{<\verb{named numeric vector}> A named numeric vector of zoom
levels. Usually one of the \code{map_zoom_levels_x}, or the output of
\code{\link{zoom_get_levels}}. It needs to be \code{numeric} as the function
will sort them to make sure the lower zoom level is first, and the highest
is last (so it makes sense on an auto-scale).}

\item{region}{<\code{character}> The region to retrieve the zoom levels for,
usually one of the output of \code{\link{zoom_get_levels}}.}
}
\value{
A character string representing the zoom level and region name,
separated by an underscore
}
\description{
Given a named numeric vector of zoom levels, a numeric value representing the current
zoom level, and a character string representing the name of the region, this
function returns a string representing the zoom level and region name,
separated by an underscore. The zoom level is determined by finding the
highest value in the zoom levels vector that is less than or equal to the
current zoom level.
