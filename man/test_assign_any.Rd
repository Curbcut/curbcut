\usage{
test_assign_any(
  var_left,
  var_right = " ",
  df = "city_CSD",
  select_id = NA,
  pos = 1,
  data_path = .curbcut_montreal_data
)
}
\arguments{
\item{var_left}{<\verb{reactive character}> Character string of the selected
variable, e.g. \code{alp_2016} or \code{c("housing_tenant_2006", "housing_tenant_2016")}.}

\item{var_right}{<\verb{reactive character}> Character string of the selected
compared variable, e.g. \code{housing_value_2016}. Defaults to what no compared
variable is represented by (" ").}

\item{df}{<\code{character}> The combination of the region under study
and the scale at which the user is on, e.g. \code{CMA_CSD}. Defaults to
\code{city_CSD}.}

\item{select_id}{<\code{character}> The select_id to assign in the global environment.
Defaults to NA.}

\item{pos}{<\code{numeric}> An integer value indicating the position in the search list where
the environment to be used for assignment is located. Default is 1, which is
typically the global environment.}
}
\value{
This function doesn't return a value. It modifies the specified
environment by assigning values to certain variables.
}
\description{
This function is used to recreate a variable selection, data, df, ... in the
global environment, helping to test line-by-line functions.
}
\details{
This function uses the vars_build function to create a new set of
variables using var_left, var_right, and df. It then retrieves the
corresponding data using the data_get function.
It then assigns each of these variables, along with df, region (which is
the piece before the underscode in \code{df}), and select_id to the specified environment.
