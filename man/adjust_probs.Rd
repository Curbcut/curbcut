\title{Adjust Probabilities for Quantile Breaks}
\usage{
adjust_probs(probs, breaks, min_gap)
}
\arguments{
\item{probs}{<\verb{numeric vector}> A numeric vector of probabilities.}

\item{breaks}{<\verb{numeric vector}> A numeric vector of quantile breaks
corresponding to \code{probs}.}

\item{min_gap}{<\code{numeric}> Minimum gap to maintain between consecutive
probabilities.}
}
\value{
<\verb{numeric vector}> An adjusted vector of probabilities where each
element is non-zero and consecutive elements have at least \code{min_gap}
difference.
}
\description{
This function incrementally adjusts a vector of probabilities used for
quantile breaks. It ensures that each break has a non-zero value and
maintains at least a specified minimum gap between each consecutive
probability value.
