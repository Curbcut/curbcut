\usage{
cc_dbPool(
  drv,
  ...,
  token_default_duration = 14 * 60,
  minSize = 1,
  maxSize = Inf,
  idleTimeout = 60,

}
\arguments{
\item{drv}{The database driver.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to the database driver's connect method.}

\item{token_default_duration}{Duration in seconds before the token expires.
Defaults to 14 * 60 (14 minutes).}

\item{minSize}{Minimum number of connections in the pool.}

\item{maxSize}{Maximum number of connections in the pool. Set to \code{Inf}
for no limit.}

\item{idleTimeout}{Time in seconds a connection can remain idle before being
closed, to free resources.}

\item{validationInterval}{Time in seconds to wait between validation checks
on idle connections.}

\item{validateQuery}{SQL query used to validate a connection is still active.}
}
\value{
An object representing the database connection pool, with enhanced
token management capabilities.
}
\description{
A reimplementation of \code{\link[pool]{dbPool}} designed to handle database
connections using short-lived authentication tokens. It includes mechanisms
for token validation, regeneration, and secure storage within the function's scope.
